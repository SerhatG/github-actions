## AERIUS github-actions
Contains composite GitHub actions to be used by other repositories in the organisation.
You are free to use them as well, as they could make sense for your projects.
Improvements are welcome, but our focus will be to support our other public repositories.

### Versioning
We use branches that should never break current functionality.
Changes should only add to it or implement fixes warranted by changes to the github actions ecosystem/modules used.
A new branch will be created if a change to our own functionality would break repositories using the current branch.
